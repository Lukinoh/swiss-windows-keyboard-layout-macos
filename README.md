## Notes

- The layout is based on the German (Switzerland) layout from Windows and enables a seamless transition for users switching from Windows to macOS.
- The basis for this layout comes from the repository [weibeld-setup/install-keyboard-layout](https://github.com/weibeld-setup/install-keyboard-layout). Many thanks to the original project!
